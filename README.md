# Project ToDoList

Matr. Nr: 2571029

# Requirements

The To Do List Project web app has two pages. A start page with a calendar of one month and a day page with a day specific to-do list. Both pages have a navigation bar on the top.

**Start Page:** This page shows a calendar view of one month. Each day has the number of to-dos (stored in the app) listed below the date this includes all to-dos, even those that are already checked. A click on any day opens the corresponding to-do list in the same tab (links to the day page). The start page has a navbar at the top as described in the navbar section of the requirements.

**Day Page**: This page shows the to-dos of the selected day in a list format. It allows the user to add new to-dos to the list and check of or delete individual to-do items. The day page also has a navbar at the top as described in the navbar section of the requirements.

**Nav Bar**: The navigation bar is shown at the top of both pages. It consists of three components: (1) A heading showing the title of the page and (2) a button to navigate to the start page (month view) and a button to navigate to todays to do list (day view).

# Concept

This section describes the interpretation of the basic requirements and their implementation to a minimal degree.

**Start Page:** The start page uses the [react-calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar) package for the month view. The calendar component is parametrised using props in a way to restrict itâ€™s functionality to only showing the month February. This month was chosen since I expect the project will be graded then. 

The tileContent prop is used to add the number of to-dos for each day to the default calendar tile, by calling a function that returns a custom component (CalenderTile) parametrised with day and toDoStore (data object). CalendarTile uses these props to look up the number of to-dos for the given day and returns a paragraph with this information. 

Further the calendar uses the onClickDay property to call a function that navigates to the day page for the day the user clicked on. This function uses [react router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and its Link component to navigate to /todo/id using the useNavigate hook where id ist the day the user clicked on.  

**Day Page:** The Day / To Do Page (/todo/id) shows a to-do list for each day and an input field for new to-dos. The given day is extracted from the URL using the useParams hook. Each to-do item has the following components: (1) A text section that displays the text of each given task. (2) A checkbox to mark a to do as completed. When checked the text of a given to do is greyed out and crossed out using conditional rendering. (3) A delete button to remove the item from the to do list.

**Data Handling**:  Each to-do item is stored in a JS Object with two items: (1) text - storing the task text and (2) checked - storing if an item is checked or not. All to-do items for a given day are stored as values in another object (key - ascending numeric index). The object with the items is stored as a value in another object that has items for each day of February, (keys being the date (e.g. 1 for the first of a month)). This object is stored as a useState hook in App.jsx and passed down to the necessary sub components and updated using props and two-way-bindings.

**Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar is implemented as described in the requirements section. An important note is that the today button links to the current day. Since the app is implemented specifically for the month February, the functionality of the today button may be impaired if the actual date is higher than 28.

# Summary

To keep it short. After some trial and error everything worked out great. The project was fun and a good way to learn the implementation of basic concepts in react.
